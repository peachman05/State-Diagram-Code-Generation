The traffic light example project is based on Java and contains a small GUI 
that demonstrate the state machine behaviour in /model/TrafficLightWaiting.sct. 
This example combines generated java code with manual Java implementations (the GUI). 
To start the application run src/trafficlight_example/TrafficlightDemo.java. 
In Eclipse select the project in the project explorer and right-click to open the 
context menu. Select 'Run As > Java Application'. The application will start and 
everything else should be self explaining

ATTENTION:

1! The example REQUIRES a JAVA 8 JDK. 

2! When you installed the example then Eclipse may show errors on the project. This 
is likely due to a missing configuration of the JDK. In this case select 'Properties'
from the context menu on the project and set the correct JDK in 'Java Build Path'. You 
will find further help in the 'Java development user guide' section of the Eclipse help.
