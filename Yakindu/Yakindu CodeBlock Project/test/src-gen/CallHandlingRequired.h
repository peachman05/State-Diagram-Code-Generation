/*! \file This header defines prototypes for all functions that are required by the state machine implementation.

This is a state machine uses time events which require access to a timing service. Thus the function prototypes:
	- callHandling_setTimer and
	- callHandling_unsetTimer
are defined.

These functions will be called during a 'run to completion step' (runCycle) of the statechart. 
There are some constraints that have to be considered for the implementation of these functions:
	- never call the statechart API functions from within these functions.
	- make sure that the execution time is as short as possible.
